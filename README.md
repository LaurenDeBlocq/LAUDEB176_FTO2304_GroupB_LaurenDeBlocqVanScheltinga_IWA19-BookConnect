1. fixed importing and exporting. No files were being imported into scripts and data was not exporting.

2. Most of what the previous developer did seems to have very incorrect notation surrounding query selectors. I'll debug that and
   then see what logic errors might be lurking

3. Created a short cut list of interactive objects (eg search button) that will be dealt with regularly for ease of use.
